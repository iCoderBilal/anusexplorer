                    It used to be white but then came Uranus. As we all know,
                    who controls the memes controls the universe and Uranus is
                    on course to get pumped.

                    So don’t pass gas fees on this one or else you’ll miss out

            Understanding Currency As A Shared Belief

            So swallow whole, with these holy vibes, cause this worlds ill.
            <br />
            <br />
            And spread it, since clearly that pill is passing through Uranus.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currency itself is a shared belief system, its value is defined
            based on how we value it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gold worked great for this until 1971 when the US decided to stop
            being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shit coin
            was born.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thus, an ultimate source of power was formed. The ability to
            literally print money.
            <br />
            <br />
            And around it an oasis of corruption is inevitable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Any instrument so powerful, that the greediest people alive all seek
            it, becomes evil lurking who would do anything to protect it.
            <br />
            <br />
            From corruption to cabal, this is where the collective idea of an
            evil mafia came from.
            <br />
            <br />
            Collective idea, huh, thats exactly what a meme is after all.
          </p>
          <div className="w-[100%]">
            <img

            And this meme is real, except rather than an old-school town mafia,
            this one has the money printer, and thus runs the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unlimited funding can make most problems go away, and now it gave
            those with the power to do so a reason to print.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because printing money is key for war, and safety.
            <br />
            <br />
            Make the world less safe? <br />
            Start a global pandemic? <br />
            Start proxy wars?
            <br />
            <br />
            A good reason to print money, is always bad thing for the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Incentives are kinda like assholes, they get extra shitty when
            they’re not maintained.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bad incentives lead to bad actors printing trillions of cents.
            <br />
            <br />
            But right now, we're just making sense of it all.

            The Rise of Bitcoin - Old Guard and Redefining Power

            This exact understanding was what led the pioneers of Bitcoin and
            its early supporters into action.
            <br />
            <br />
            Led by something bigger than money… a cure to the mafia's greatest
            ally, the printing machine, whose side effects are best found if you
            search up WTF happened in 1971, the year we created that bitch.
            <br />
            <br />
            So you may wonder the recent rally at hand, well, while a certain
            bank man fried crypto for a bit, the inevitable nature of its
            existence has steamrolled into the hearts, minds, and wallets of the
            mafia itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            There’s been a vibe shift.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bitcoin is the gunshot heard around the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mafia members grabbed their own share and now with a profit
            incentive pushed gigantic financial institutions into their
            investment.
            <br />
            <br />
            What they may or may not realize, is this greed will ultimately be
            their downfall.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many of the corrupt, are just broken souls, so with the chance to
            repent “if you can’t beat em, join em” became self evident.
            <br />
            <br />
            And great, if Bitcoin wins they lose the printing power, but does it
            really have the narrative? The better question is to ask, would they
            have ever let it get this big if it did?
            <br />
            <br />
            The horse and carriage started the race, but with Uranus we can
            reach the finish.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'd say its the perfect resistance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sounds tight, right?
            <br />
            <br />
            Jokes aside,
            <br />
            Uranus represents an astronomical tool to make our global mafia's
            power take a big fat dump.

            If this video is your first time understanding the power of the meme
            token revolution, the first token you’ve seen to actually go deep, a
            token representing cosmic memeing beyond dog coin.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then you get where this all flushes out.
            <br />
            <br />
            From here on out, let it be embeded into your brain, every time you
            wipe your ass and see that white paper you turned brown, for Uranus
            and what it taught you about dumping the global mafia's source of
            power.
            <br />
            <br />
            So don’t fee ought, fear not, because the Bitcoin whitepaper was
            truly just the beginning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Life is not so black or white, and at the end of the day we all
            leave the same skid mark on our world.
            <br />
            <br />
            So let this be a rally cry for humanity to collectively realize we
            are the shit, for then we may repeat history and live in a world by
            the people, and for the people once again.

            comedy gold is an ounce more of hope for our future.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s time to let golden memes light up the world, because central

            The age of Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs

            <br />

            While some seek the just a full moon, we seek the depths of Uranus.
